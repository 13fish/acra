ACRA allows your application to send Crash Reports.
This tutorial will guide you in installing ACRA in your application project.

= Details =

Step by step installation of the ACRA library in an existing application project:
  * Get http://acra.googlecode.com/files/ACRA-1.0.0.zip and open the archive
  * Login to your Google Docs account
  * Import the CrashReports-template.xls contained in the archive
  * Open the imported document
  * Rename it as you like
  * Forms / Create form
  * Add anything in the form description just to enable the "save" button
  * Save the form
  * Copy the formId displayed at the bottom of the form creation page
  * Open your eclipse project
  * Create a lib folder
  * Add the ACRA jar file in the lib folder
  * Right-click on the jar file / add to build path
  * Create a new class in your package root
    * Give it a name like : MyApplication, make it extend CrashReportingApplication
    * Override the abstract getFormId() method, returning a simple String containing the form Id

{{{
    @Override
    public String getFormId() {
        return "dGVacG0ydHVnaHNjRjVTUTEtb3FPWGc6MQ";
    }
}}}

  * Open the android manifest editor
    * In the Application tab, click on the Browse button next to the Name field
    * Select your newly created Application class
    * In the Permissions tab, add a *Uses Permission* object with value {{{android.permission.INTERNET}}}
  * THE END - next time your application crashes, it adds a line to your Google Docs spreadsheet :-).
