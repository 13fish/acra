= Introduction =

ACRA allows your Android application to send Crash Reports in a Google Docs spreadsheet.
This tutorial will guide you in installing ACRA in your application project.

= Details =

Step by step installation of the ACRA library in an existing application project:
  * Get http://acra.googlecode.com/files/ACRA-2.0.0.zip and open the archive 
  * Login to your Google Docs account
  * Import the {{{CrashReports-template.csv}}} contained in the archive (ACRA-2.0.0/CrashReport/doc)
  * Open the imported document
  * Rename it as you like
  * In the menu, click on Forms / Create form
  * Add anything in the form description just to enable the *Save* button
  * Save the form
  * Copy the {{{formId}}} displayed in the link at the bottom of the form creation page
  * Open your Eclipse project
  * Create a {{{lib}}} folder
  * Add the {{{acra-2.0.0.jar}}} from the archive (ACRA-2.0.0/CrashReport/build) in the {{{lib}}} folder
  * Right-click on the jar file / add to build path
  * Create a new class in your package root
    * Give it a name like : {{{MyApplication}}}, make it extend {{{org.acra.CrashReportingApplication}}}
    * Override the abstract {{{getFormId()}}} method, returning a simple String containing the form Id of your Google Docs form :

{{{
    @Override
    public String getFormId() {
        return "dGVacG0ydVHnaNHjRjVTUTEtb3FPWGc6MQ";
    }
}}}

  * Open the android manifest editor ({{{AndroidManifest.xml}}}
    * In the *Application tab*, click on the *Browse* button next to the *Name* field
    * Select your newly created Application class ({{{MyApplication}}})
    * In the *Permissions* tab, add a *Uses Permission* object with value {{{android.permission.INTERNET}}}
  * *_THE END_* - next time your application crashes, it adds a line to your Google Docs spreadsheet :-).

*Bonus :* Google Docs spreadsheet allow to configure notifications on changes. Juste set your preferences in  : Share (Top right button) / Set notification rules

= Advanced Usage =

== User notification ==

The default behaviour of ACRA is to send crash reports silently. From the application user point of view, the application has crashed with the usual "Force Close" dialog, and that's all.

As a developer, you might prefer notifying your users that a crash report has been sent, or even ask him the authorization so send one... and why not ask him to describe what he was doing during the crash...

ACRA offers all these options, and allow you to customize your application crash reporting notifications.

2 main notification modes are available:
  * display a simple Toast with your developer designed text

  * display a status bar notification, then offering the user a dialog asking him to send the report or not, with an optional comment field you can chose to add or not.

== How-to use it to send a report to my own php/java/python/whateveryouwant self-hosted script ? ==

Just override the getFormUri() in your Application class extending CrashReportingApplication :

{{{
    public Uri getFormUri() {
        return Uri.parse("http://myserver.com/myscript");
    }
}}}

Then your script has to follow the fields mapping exposed in the [http://code.google.com/p/acra/source/browse/trunk/CrashReport/src/org/acra/ErrorReporter.java#70 ErrorReporter] class.

== Can I add my own variables content in the crash report ? ==

Absolutely !

Simply use the following method in key places in your code :
{{{
        ErrorReporter.getInstance().addCustomData("myVariable", myVariable);
}}}

All your custom data (only latest value for each one) will be added in the column "custom" just before the stack trace, one key = value pair per line.
