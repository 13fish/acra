locale=fr_FR
hardKeyboardHidden=HARDKEYBOARDHIDDEN_YES
keyboard=KEYBOARD_NOKEYS
keyboardHidden=KEYBOARDHIDDEN_NO
fontScale=1.0
mcc=208
mnc=10
navigation=NAVIGATION_TRACKBALL
navigationHidden=NAVIGATIONHIDDEN_NO
orientation=ORIENTATION_PORTRAIT
screenLayout=SCREENLAYOUT_SIZE_NORMAL+SCREENLAYOUT_LONG_YES

touchscreen=TOUCHSCREEN_FINGER

userSetLocale=false
}}}

=== crash_configuration ===

  [http://developer.android.com/intl/fr/reference/android/content/res/Configuration.html Configuration] fields state on the application crash.

  Example :
  
{{{
locale=fr_FR
hardKeyboardHidden=HARDKEYBOARDHIDDEN_YES
keyboard=KEYBOARD_NOKEYS
keyboardHidden=KEYBOARDHIDDEN_NO
fontScale=1.0
mcc=208
mnc=10
navigation=NAVIGATION_TRACKBALL
navigationHidden=NAVIGATIONHIDDEN_NO
orientation=ORIENTATION_LANDSCAPE
screenLayout=SCREENLAYOUT_SIZE_NORMAL+SCREENLAYOUT_LONG_YES
seq=120
touchscreen=TOUCHSCREEN_FINGER
uiMode=UI_MODE_TYPE_NORMAL+UI_MODE_NIGHT_NO
userSetLocale=false
}}}

  As an example of how this field can help you debug your application, you can see here that the "seq" field has been increased from 117 to 119. This means that 2 configuration changes occurred between the Application start and the crash. You can also see that the orientation changed from LANDSCAPE to PORTRAIT. There could be lots of issues regarding orientation (and other configuration) changes handling, so if you don't understand how a bug happens, having a look at this values can help you understand what the user did with his device.
  
  Though, having seq value increased does not mean that these changes occured while your application was active. There can be lots of things happening between your application start and the crash. For example, a user can start your application and use it on day 1 without any issue, use many other applications in between, reopen your application on day 2 (which was still started but paused) and then the crash occurs. All the configuration changes that happened in between introduce a change in the seq value.
