= THIS DOCUMENT IS A WORK IN PROGRESS FOR THE 3.2 RELEASE =

= Introduction =

ACRA allows your Android application to send Crash Reports to various destinations:
  * a Google Docs spreadsheet (default and original behavior)
  * an email (new in 3.2)
  * your own server-side HTTP POST script (parameter names changed in 3.2)
  * any other possible destination by implementing your own report sender (new in 3.2)

When a crash occurs, you can choose and configure 3 different ways of interacting with the user:
  * Silent (default): ACRA actions are not visible. The crash report is sent and then the default android crash system does its job (Force Close dialog)
  * Toast: When the crash occurs, ACRA displays a [http://developer.android.com/intl/fr/guide/topics/ui/notifiers/toasts.html toas]...
   
This tutorial will guide you through installing ACRA in your application project.

= Setting-up your project =

Step by step installation of the ACRA library in an existing application project, with the simplest settings:
  * Get http://acra.googlecode.com/files/acra-3.2.0.zip and open the archive 
  * Login to your Google Docs account
  * Import the {{{CrashReports-template.csv}}} contained in the archive (acra-3.2.0/CrashReport/doc), with conversion enabled
  * Open the imported document
  * Rename it as you like
  * In the menu, click on Forms / Create form
  * Add anything in the form description just to enable the *Save* button
    * If you are using a private Google Apps domain, make sure to *uncheck* the option "Require yourdomain.com sign-in to view this form."
  * Save the form
  * Copy the {{{formkey}}} value displayed in the link at the bottom of the form creation page
  * Open your Eclipse project
  * Create a {{{lib}}} folder
  * Add the {{{acra-3.2.0.jar}}} from the archive (acra-3.2.0/CrashReport/build) in the {{{lib}}} folder
  * Right-click on the jar file / add to build path
  * Create a new class in your package root
    * Give it a name like: {{{MyApplication}}}, make it extend {{{android.app.Application}}}
    * Above the declaration of the {{{MyApplication}}} class, add the @ReportsCrashes annotation with your Google Docs form Id as a parameter 

{{{
    @ReportsCrashes(formKey = "dGVacG0ydVHnaNHjRjVTUTEtb3FPWGc6MQ") 
    public class MyApplication extends Application {
    }
}}}
    * In the {{{MyApplication}}} class, override the onCreate() method to add the ACRA init statement
{{{
    @Override
    public void onCreate() {
        // The following line triggers the initialization of ACRA
        ACRA.init(this);
        super.onCreate();
    }
}}}
  * Open the android manifest editor ({{{AndroidManifest.xml}}}
    * In the *Application tab*, click on the *Browse* button next to the *Name* field
    * Select your newly created Application class ({{{MyApplication}}}).
    This adds an {{{android:name}}} attribute to your {{{application}}} element like this (put the full name with package if the application class package is not the same as manifest root element declared pakage):
{{{
<application android:icon="@drawable/icon" android:label="@string/app_name"
                android:name="MyApplication">
}}}
    * In the *Permissions* tab, add a *Uses Permission* object with value {{{android.permission.INTERNET}}}.
    This adds the following element as a child of the {{{manifest}}} element:
{{{
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"></uses-permission>
}}}
  * *_THE END_* - next time your application crashes, it adds a line to your Google Docs spreadsheet :-).

*Bonus :* Google Docs spreadsheet allow to configure notifications on changes. Juste set your preferences in  : Share (Top right button) / Set notification rules and get notified by mail when reports are sent !

= Advanced Usage =

== User notification ==

The default behavior of ACRA is to send crash reports silently. From the application user point of view, the application has crashed with the usual "Force Close" dialog, and that's all.

As a developer, you might prefer notifying your users that a crash report has been sent, or even ask him the authorization so send one... and why not ask him to describe what he was doing during the crash...

ACRA offers all these options, and allow you to customize your application crash reporting notifications.

2 main notification modes are available:
  * display a simple Toast with your developer designed text
http://acra.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/CrashReport/doc/captures/notif_toast.png
  * display a status bar notification, then offering the user a dialog asking him to send the report or not, with an optional comment field you can chose to add or not.
http://acra.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/CrashReport/doc/captures/notif_ticker.png http://acra.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/CrashReport/doc/captures/notif.png http://acra.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/CrashReport/doc/captures/notif_dialog_full.png

Enabling user notification only requires you to add parameters to the @ReportsCrashes annotation :

  * Toast notification:

{{{
@ReportsCrashes(formKey="dGVacG0ydVHnaNHjRjVTUTEtb3FPWGc6MQ",
                mode = ReportingInteractionMode.TOAST,
                resToastText = R.string.crash_toast_text)
public class MyApplication extends Application {
...
}}}

In your {{{strings.xml}}} :
{{{
<string name="crash_toast_text">Ooooops ! I crashed, but a report has been sent to my developer to help him fix the issue !</string>
}}}

  * Status bar notification:

{{{
@ReportsCrashes(formKey="dGVacG0ydVHnaNHjRjVTUTEtb3FPWGc6MQ",
                mode = ReportingInteractionMode.NOTIFICATION,
                resToastText = R.string.crash_toast_text, // optional, displayed as soon as the crash occurs, before collecting data which can take a few seconds
                resNotifTickerText = R.string.crash_notif_ticker_text,
                resNotifTitle = R.string.crash_notif_title,
                resNotifText = R.string.crash_notif_text,
                resNotifIcon = android.R.drawable.stat_notify_error, // optional. default is a warning sign
                resDialogText = R.string.crash_dialog_text,
                resDialogIcon = android.R.drawable.ic_dialog_info, //optional. default is a warning sign
                resDialogTitle = R.string.crash_dialog_title, // optional. default is your application name
                resDialogCommentPrompt = R.string.crash_dialog_comment_prompt, // optional. when defined, adds a user text field input with this text resource as a label
                resDialogOkToast = R.string.crash_dialog_ok_toast // optional. displays a Toast message when the user accepts to send a report.
                )
public class MyApplication extends Application {
...
}}}

In your {{{strings.xml}}}:
{{{
<string name="crash_toast_text">Ooooops ! I crashed, but a report has been sent to my developer to help him fix the issue !</string>
<string name="crash_notif_ticker_text">Unexpected error, please send a report...</string>
<string name="crash_notif_title">CrashTest has crashed...</string>
<string name="crash_notif_text">Please click here to help fix the issue.</string>
    
<string name="crash_dialog_title">CrashTest has crashed</string>
<string name="crash_dialog_text">An unexpected error occurred forcing the
    application to stop. Please help us fix this by sending us error data,
    all you have to do is click \'OK\'.</string>
<string name="crash_dialog_comment_prompt">You might add your comments about the problem below:</string>
<string name="crash_dialog_ok_toast">Thank you !</string>
}}}

In your {{{AndroidManifest.xml}}}
{{{
<application ...>

    ....

    <activity android:name="org.acra.CrashReportDialog"
        android:theme="@android:style/Theme.Dialog"
        android:launchMode="singleInstance"
        android:excludeFromRecents="true"
        android:finishOnTaskLaunch="true" />

    ....

</application>
}}}

== Reports destination ==

The default destination for reports is a Google Docs Form, storing data in a Google Docs Spreadsheet. This storage has some great advantages:
  * Use Google infrastructure: can you get a faster, more reliable free hosting anywhere else ?
  * You can share the spreadsheet with your whole dev team, with people setting their own notification preferences
  * You can easily compile stats using Google APIs. See http://zegoggl.es/2011/01/analysing-android-error-reports-using-the-google-visualisation-api.html for an example.

The only known limitation is that a Google Spreadsheet can't contain more than 400 000 cells. With ACRA 3.2 it lets you receive 11 428 crash reports in one spreadsheet... but you are allowed to delete old reports at any time!

The following sections detail the other possible destinations for your crash reports: custom script, email, or any other destination you can imagine (if you implement the sender). And you can even send reports to multiple destinations.

=== Sending reports to your own php/java/python/whateveryouwant self-hosted script ===

Just use the formUri parameter of the @ReportsCrashes annotation in your Application class :

{{{
@ReportsCrashes(formKey = "", // will not be used
                formUri = "http://yourserver.com/yourscript",
                formUriBasicAuthLogin = "yourlogin", // optional
                formUriBasicAuthPassword = "y0uRpa$$w0rd", // optional
                mode = ReportingInteractionMode.TOAST,
                resToastText = R.string.crash_toast_text)
public class MyApplication extends Application {
...
}}}

The formUri can be over HTTPS (even with self signed certificates) and can require a BASIC HTTP authentication (pass your login and password with {{{formUriBasicAuthLogin}}} and {{{formUriBasicAuthPassword}}}).

Your script will receive report fields as POST parameters named like the {{{[http://code.google.com/p/acra/source/browse/trunk/CrashReport/src/org/acra/ReportField.java ReportField]}}} enum values.

=== Sending reports by email ===

For some applications, sending reports to a Google Docs Form is not or other Http based solutions is not an option. The problem is that they require the INTERNET permission.
For pure offline applications, users might even be frightened to grant this permission and can be suspicious about the real goal of the app or the developer.

To get crash reports without granting INTERNET permission, you can use the mailTo setting from @ReportsCrashes:

{{{
@ReportsCrashes(formKey = "", // will not be used
                mailTo = "reports@yourdomain.com",
                mode = ReportingInteractionMode.TOAST,
                resToastText = R.string.crash_toast_text)
public class MyApplication extends Application {
...
}}}

Including a full report could be quite difficult due to the data size. Default fields included in email reports are:

  * ReportField.USER_COMMENT
  * ReportField.ANDROID_VERSION
  * ReportField.APP_VERSION_NAME
  * ReportField.BRAND
  * ReportField.PHONE_MODEL
  * ReportField.CUSTOM_DATA
  * ReportField.STACK_TRACE 

You can override the report fields list using the {{{mailReportFields}}} option int the @ReportsCrashes annotation: 

{{{
@ReportsCrashes(formKey = "", // will not be used
                mailTo = "reports@yourdomain.com",
                mailReportFields = { ReportField.APP_VERSION, ReportField.ANDROID_VERSION, ReportField.PHONE_MODEL, ReportField.CUSTOM_DATA, ReportField.STACK_TRACE, ReportField.LOGCAT },                
                mode = ReportingInteractionMode.TOAST,
                resToastText = R.string.crash_toast_text)
public class MyApplication extends Application {
...
}}}

Emails are sent with an {{{ACTION_SEND}}} intent. This means that the following steps are required for the application user before any report is sent:
  * pick preferred email client (if no default app set)
  * review & actually send the email

=== Implementing your own sender ===

Since ACRA v3.2, you can implement your own report sender:

{{{
public class YourOwnSender implements ReportSender {

    public YourOwnSender(... your params ...){
        // initialize your sender with needed parameters
    }

    @Override
    public void send(CrashReportData report) throws ReportSenderException {
        // Iterate over the CrashReportData instance and do whatever
        // you need with each pair of ReportField key / String value
    }
}
}}}

Three {{{ReportSender}}} implementations are already available:
  * [http://code.google.com/p/acra/source/browse/trunk/CrashReport/src/org/acra/sender/GoogleFormSender.java GoogleFormSender]: (ACRA's default) send reports to a Google Form through HTTP POST requests with specific parameters naming.
  * [http://code.google.com/p/acra/source/browse/trunk/CrashReport/src/org/acra/sender/HttpPostSender.java HttpPostSender]: send reports to an HTTP POST server-side component located at a configurable URI.
  * [http://code.google.com/p/acra/source/browse/trunk/CrashReport/src/org/acra/sender/EmailIntentSender.java EmailIntentSender]: keeps only a selected set of fields and puts them in an Intent to be send by another application. 

Once your sender created, you have to declare it to ACRA. This is done in your {{{Application}}} class, in the {{{onCreate()}}} method, right after the ACRA.init() call:

{{{
    @Override
    public void onCreate() {
        ACRA.init(this);
        YourOwnSender yourSender = new YourOwnSender(whatever, parameters, needed);
        ErrorReporter.getInstance().setReportSender(yourSender);
        super.onCreate();
    }
}}}

For advanced usage, there is a full set of available methods to manage the list of active ReportSenders:
  * setReportSender(ReportSender): sets a new sender as the single active sender
  * addReportSender(ReportSender): adds a new sender to the list of active senders, without removing all previous active senders
  * removeReportSender(ReportSender): removes a specific instance of a sender
  * removeReportSenders(Class): removes all active instances of a specific ReportSender implementation
  * removeAllReportSenders(): clears the list of active ReportSenders

== Adding your own variables content in crash reports ==

To help you track some specific issue, you can add custom data to reports.

Simply use the following method in key places in your code :
{{{
ErrorReporter.getInstance().putCustomData("myVariable", myVariable);
}}}

All your custom data (only latest value for each one) will be added in the column "custom" just before the stack trace, one key = value pair per line.

You can also use {{{getCustomData("myVariable")}}} and {{{removeCustomData("myVariable")}}} to get/remove data from the custom data map.

== Adding logcat extract to reports ==

You can enable adding a [http://developer.android.com/intl/fr/guide/developing/tools/adb.html#logcat logcat] extract to your reports by simply adding the {{{READ_LOGS}}} permission:
{{{
<manifest ...>
    ...
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_LOGS"></uses-permission>
</manifest>
}}}

The default behavior is to include the result of the following command:
{{{
    adb logcat -t 200 -v time
}}}

This results to 200 lines of logcat with date, invocation time, priority/tag, and PID of the originating process.

If this is not what you want, you can change this with your own command line using the {{{logcatArguments}}} in the {{{@ReportsCrashes}}} annotation. For example, if you prefer using:
{{{
    adb logcat -t 100 -v long ActivityManager:I MyApp:D *:S
}}}
then add this to you {@ReportsCrashes} config:
{{{
    logcatArguments = { "-t", "100", "-v", "long", "ActivityManager:I", "MyApp:D", "*:S" }
}}}
As you can see, you just have to split your command line arguments to a String array on each white space.

Note for experts: even if the "-t XXX" argument is only available since android 2.2, you can use it safely as ACRA emulates it for older devices.
  
In addition to the {{{main}}} default buffer, you can configure ACRA to retrieve the 2 other alternative buffers {{{event}}} and {{{radio}}}. This is done with 2 {{{@ReportsCrashes}}} configuration items {{{includeEventsLogcat}}} and {{{includeRadioLogcat}}} which take {{{boolean}}} values.

== Adding the Device ID to your reports ==

In some circumstances, tracking exactly which identified devices throw which report can be necessary. ACRA will include your users Device ID (IMEI for GSM and the MEID or ESN for CDMA phones) if you add the following permission to your application manifest:

{{{
<manifest ...>
    ...
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_PHONE_STATE"></uses-permission>
</manifest>
}}}


== Letting your users control ACRA ==

Some ACRA behaviors can be configured by your application users through the use of {{{SharedPreferences}}} items:
  * enable/disable ACRA
  * enable/disable system logs
  * enable/disable including DeviceID
  * set an email address to be added to reports
  * enable/disable auto accept reports

If your {{{SharedPreferences}}} are not the application default {{{SharedPreferences}}}, you can provide ACRA with your own {{{SharedPreferences}}} name using the following {{{@ReportsCrashes}}} parameters:
  * {{{sharedPreferencesName}}}: Name of the {{{SharedPreferences}}} that will host the {{{acra.enable}}} or {{{acra.disable}}} preference.
  * {{{sharedPreferencesMode}}}: The mode that you need for the {{{SharedPreference}}} file creation: {{{Context.MODE_PRIVATE}}}, {{{Context.MODE_WORLD_READABLE}}} or {{{Context.MODE_WORLD_WRITEABLE}}}. 

=== enable/disable ACRA ===

Add to your preferences xml file a CheckBoxPreference (checking it disables ACRA) :
{{{
<CheckBoxPreference android:key="acra.disable"
    android:title="@string/pref_disable_acra"
    android:summaryOn="@string/pref_acra_disabled"
    android:summaryOff="@string/pref_acra_enabled"
    android:defaultValue="false"/>
}}}

Or if you prefer the opposite (checking it to enable ACRA):
{{{
<CheckBoxPreference android:key="acra.enable"
    android:title="@string/pref_disable_acra"
    android:summaryOn="@string/pref_acra_enabled"
    android:summaryOff="@string/pref_acra_disabled"
    android:defaultValue="true"/>
}}}

Then add to your {{{strings.xml}}} files the 3 corresponding string resources.

=== Enable/disable system logs ===

Including logcat extracts in reports is a great tool for developers, but it can lead to privacy issues as some other applications might log private data like user account names, opened URLs, calendar events...

Giving your users a way to control the inclusion of logcat data make them understand that you care about their privacy. This can be done with the inclusion of the following {{{CheckBoxPreference}}}:

{{{
 <CheckBoxPreference android:key="acra.syslog.enable"
    android:summaryOn="@string/pref_acra_syslog_enabled"
    android:summaryOff="@string/pref_acra_syslog_disabled"
    android:title="@string/pref_acra_syslog"
    android:defaultValue="true"/>
}}}

Of course you have to define the matching strings in your {{{strings.xml}}} files.

=== Enable/disable including DeviceID ===

If you added the {{{READ_PHONE_STATE}}} permission to your application but
want to let your user be able to disable the inclusion of their Device ID in
crash reports, you can include the following {{{CheckBoxPreference}}}:

{{{
 <CheckBoxPreference android:key="acra.deviceid.enable"
    android:title="@string/pref_acra_deviceid"
    android:summaryOn="@string/pref_acra_deviceid_enabled"
    android:summaryOff="@string/pref_acra_deviceid_disabled" 
    android:defaultValue="true"/>
}}}

Don't forget to add the required strings in your {{{strings.xml}}} files.

=== Set an email address to be added to reports ===

Some users might be willing to help debugging your app. You can ask them
to input an email address that will be included in every report to allow you
contact them:  

{{{
 <EditTextPreference android:key="acra.user.email"
    android:title="@string/pref_acra_user_email"
    android:summary="@string/pref_acra_user_email_summary"/>
}}}

=== Enable/disable auto accept reports ===

While in NOTIFICATION mode, you can allow your users to choose to auto-accept sending all reports. This is like letting them switch from NOTIFICATION mode to TOAST mode.

{{{
 <CheckBoxPreference android:key="acra.alwaysaccept"
    android:title="@string/pref_acra_alwaysaccept"
    android:summaryOn="@string/pref_acra_alwaysaccept_enabled"
    android:summaryOff="@string/pref_acra_alwaysaccept_disabled"
    android:defaultValue="false"/>
}}}

== Sending reports for caught exceptions or for unexpected application state without any exception ==

As a good programmer, your code is full of try/catch statements, and sometimes an interesting (unexpected) exception might be caught in one of these.

You could also want your application to send a report without any Exception thrown, just because you know that your application is in an unexpected state.

Both of these needs can be covered by this :

{{{
ErrorReporter.getInstance().handleException(caughtException);
}}} 

You can provide any caught or custom Exception, or even {{{null}}} if you don't have any to provide.

If you need to add silent trace reports whatever notification mode you configured for your application, you can also use:

{{{
ErrorReporter.getInstance().handleSilentException(caughtException);
}}}
